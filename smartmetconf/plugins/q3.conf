#
# Q3 CONFIGURATION
#
# 'log':    "stderr"
#           "syslog user|daemon|local0..local7" (facility name)
#
# 'package_path':   Where to look for source addons (like LUA_PATH)
# 'package_cpath':  Where to look for binary addons (like LUA_CPATH)
#                   <http://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/manual.html#pdf-package.path>
#                   <http://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/manual.html#pdf-package.cpath>
#
# 'killtime': max time for a script to run (global only)
# 'testbed': location of online testbed file (global only)
# 'refresh': time in between data refreshes ('false' for none)
# 'runs':   hours between model runs (3h/6h/12h/none); affects how use of
#           negative origintimes (-1,-2,...) behaves.
# 'rootdir': path prepended to file masks (unless they start with '/') (global only)
#
# Filters are given under the name of their producer (s.a. 'HIR= {') which
# can be used in fetches to focus the fetch on some producer(s) only.
#
# Defaults can be given either at the global level, or within a producer id's
# subtable. They must be before the filter items they are to affect.
#
# With archives, file paths should contain "/**/" to mark a discontinuity
# between parent path and actual file mask (usually '*.sqd.bz2"). This is
# because the existing KAP archiving uses directory levels s.a. 2007/200705/.
#
# NOTE:
#   This configuration is used as is ('/etc/q3server/q3server.conf') for the standalone
#   q3 server. It is used slightly modified ('/etc/brainstorm/plugins/q3plugin.conf') for
#   Brainstorm q3 plugin (logging is directed to different syslog category, to allow both
#   instances to coexist - in different ports).     --AKa 11-May-10
#

#---
# Note: Brainstorm directs 'stderr' to '/smartmet/logs/brainstorm'
#
# q3server uses:    syslog local1
# q3plugin uses:    syslog local2
# debugging uses:   stderr
#
log=syslog local1

# Note: 'q3server-addons/?.lua' matches also 'areamask.xxx' -> 'q3server-addons/areamask/xxx.lua'
